# XRDP + XFCE Desktop Environment Setup Script for Ubuntu VMs
#
# PURPOSE:
# This script sets up a remote-accessible Ubuntu VM with a lightweight GUI 
# (XFCE) and XRDP for Remote Desktop Protocol access. It's designed for 
# development environments, remote labs, or cloud VMs that need GUI access.
#
# It also disables all sleep/suspend modes to ensure the VM stays awake
# and accessible via RDP at all times.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
# 1. Updates the system's package index.
# 2. Installs the XFCE4 desktop environment and session manager.
# 3. Installs XRDP for remote desktop access.
# 4. Enables XRDP to start at system boot.
# 5. Adds the xrdp user to the ssl-cert group (required for XRDP cert access).
# 6. Configures the current user's session to start XFCE when XRDP connects.
# 7. Prevents the VM from sleeping or hibernating:
#    - Masks sleep.target, suspend.target, hibernate.target, hybrid-sleep.target.
# 8. Restarts XRDP to apply all changes.
